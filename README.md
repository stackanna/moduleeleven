## Project Overview
Dana’s wants us to build a webpage to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results 
After building a webpage, we were able to create a filter for each type of data in the row using javascript. To use the filter, you would type the specific keywords into the corresponding search box, then pressing enter.
